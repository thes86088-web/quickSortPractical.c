1. define the function body for quickSort algorithm

2. push "n" amount of random integers into a file (write mode)

3. record the time required to perform quicksort procedure (time module in C)

4. record the value of "n" and "t" in their separate files as well ( append mode )

5. plot each value of "t" vs "n" (matplotlib)
